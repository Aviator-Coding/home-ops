## [2026-03-21] Ceph monitor mon.j crash loop — RocksDB store corruption on talos-1

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Node** | talos-1 (10.10.10.11) |
| **Component** | Local storage (openebs-hostpath) |
| **Affected service** | mon.j (rook-ceph-mon-j) |
| **Severity** | high |

### Root cause

RocksDB SST file `154904.sst` in mon-j's store developed a block checksum mismatch, indicating silent data corruption on the underlying openebs-hostpath volume (`/var/openebs/local/pvc-df451fee-f19a-4568-9e50-891988442cab`). The corruption was detected during a compaction of L0 into L6. Once RocksDB flagged the background error, all subsequent writes were rejected, causing mon-j to abort on every sync attempt. Suspected cause is either an unclean node shutdown or a silent bit-flip on the local disk.

### Evidence

```
rocksdb: Corruption: block checksum mismatch: stored = 467716038, computed = 938189546, type = 4
  in /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-j/store.db/154904.sst offset 13748504 size 103348

rocksdb: submit_common error: Corruption: block checksum mismatch (same as above)
  Rocksdb transaction rejected — MonitorDBStore::apply_transaction() -> ceph_abort_msg("failed to write to db")

Crash backtrace: Monitor::sync_start -> apply_transaction -> failed to write to db -> abort
55+ restarts in CrashLoopBackOff over ~4.5 hours
```

### Impact

- Ceph cluster degraded to `HEALTH_WARN` — 1/3 mons down, quorum maintained by mon.h and mon.i
- Rook operator unable to schedule replacement mon-k due to host port conflicts (3300/6789 held by crashing mon-j pod)
- No data loss — all 6 OSDs healthy, all PGs active+clean
- Reduced fault tolerance — loss of one more mon would break quorum

### Resolution

Delete mon-j deployment and PVC to free host ports and remove corrupted store. The Rook operator will automatically create a replacement monitor that syncs a fresh monstore from the quorum.

```bash
kubectl -n rook-ceph delete deployment rook-ceph-mon-j
kubectl -n rook-ceph delete pvc rook-ceph-mon-j
```
